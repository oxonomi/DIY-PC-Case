# DIY-PC-Case

I designed and built an extremely compact custom PC case for my [Hackintosh](https://www.github.com/oxonomi/Hackintosh) / Gaming PC.  
<br>
I wanted a PC case small enough to fit in my backpack, but no mATX case existed under 12 litres, so I built my own. 
- Design in SketchUp (CAD)
- Built with hand tools in my garage
- Fits mATX board
- Fits Graphics Card
- Liquid CPU cooler
- Used daily for 3 years with no issue

The Graphics card is flipped with a riser cable running down the ront and up the back of the motherboard.  
With this orientation the Graphics card and PSU have direct air intakes.

If Tetris built a PC it would look like this.  
The frame was built around the components in unconventional ways to minimise the empty space.

It's like Lego meets K'nex but for adults.

No made-to-order parts where used, everything was off the shelve, no machining, the only power tool used was a hand drill.

All pictures were taken when I took it apart after 3 years of daily use, so please excuse the dust and minor damage to the panel. I wish I would have taken pictures and documented the build process but I never had any intention of sharing it online at the time.

The only trade off for having such a compact system is the lack of airflow for cooling, I never had any thermal throttling issues however it could get loud under intense loads. I've since retired the case because I wanted to use some compents for another PC and I no longer need an ultra compact powerful PC that fits into a backpack.

P.S I know a bottom mounted AIO isn't optimal, get over it Steve.
