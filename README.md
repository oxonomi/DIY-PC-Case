I designed and built a custom PC case for my [Hackintosh PC](https://www.github.com/oxonomi/Hackintosh)
I wanted a PC case small enough to fit in my backpack thta could hold an mATX board and could fit a full size graphics card, but non existed under 12 litres, so I built my own. 
- Design in SketchUp (CAD)
- Built with hand tools in my garage
- Used daily for 3 years with no issue
